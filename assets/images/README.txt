Add your Panel 1 image here as `panel-1.jpg`.

Path referenced by CSS: `assets/images/panel-1.jpg`

Notes
- Recommended size: at least 1600Ã—1000 for crisp display.
- Formats: `.jpg` preferred; `.png` also works if you update the filename in `style.css`.
- You can change the filename or location, but also update the URL in `style.css` under the `.panel-media` rule.
